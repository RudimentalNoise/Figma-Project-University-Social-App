# Figma-Project-University-Social-App
This project was developed as part of a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course.
The UniConnect project was created with the goal of developing a single digital platform that allows university students to easily and intuitively manage three fundamental aspects of academic life: sports training, university courses, and canteen services.
Through a consistent and user-friendly interface, the app enables students to connect, organize their activities, and quickly access useful information.

The app is divided into three main thematic areas, each with its own distinctive visual style:

🏋️‍♂️ Training / Sports

- View training schedules and gym availability.
- Book courses or sports facilities.
- Manage your personal training plan.

🎓 Courses / Lessons

- Access the class schedule.
- View available courses and lecturers.
- Consult course materials or receive updates and notifications.

🍽️ University Canteen

- Check daily menus and opening hours.
- Reserve meals or view availability.
- Access nutritional information and special offers.
